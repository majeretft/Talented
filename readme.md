#### Nice to have:

- [ ] Add validation for talents (.Valid(), .Validate())
- [ ] Add Error logging (such as [validation], [parsing], ect.)
- [ ] Add xml schemes (validate Xml by scheme prior to parsing)
- [ ] Count ingredients for "Witch art" set and write how many of them from where comes
- [ ] Add error handling to be able to continue working


#### Notes:

1. Scores (i.e. StatScore) currently includes talents for different types of score (i.e. creep stat, ability usage count, ect.)
2. Do not forget about TODO
