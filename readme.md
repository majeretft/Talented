### Initial


#### Planning:

- [ ] Web interface. Client-server architecture

#### Nice to have:

- [ ] Add validation for talents (.Valid(), .Validate())
- [ ] Add Error logging (such as [validation], [parsing], ect.)
- [ ] Add xml schemes (validate Xml by scheme prior to parsing)
- [ ] Count ingredients for "Witch art" set and show info
- [ ] Add error handling to be able to continue working
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Initial data caching 
- [ ] In-battle mode (update value on selecting/deselecting talents)
- [ ] Caclulation result caching
- [ ] Serialization (xml / binary) to be able to same UI settings and calculation result in file / DB (not a good solution becouse of no possibility to search or filter)


#### Notes:

1. Scores (i.e. StatScore) currently includes talents for different types of score (i.e. creep stat, ability usage count, ect.)
2. Do not forget about TODO
